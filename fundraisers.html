        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>One day, all children in this nation will have the opportunity to attain
            an excellent education.</p>
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>Teach For America finds outstanding leaders who commit to expanding educational opportunity, beginning with
            at
            least two years teaching in an under-resourced public school. Working shoulder-to-shoulder with students,
            educators, and community members, corps members go beyond traditional expectations to support the academic
            and
            personal growth of their students. The impact corps members have in the classroom fuels a lifelong
            commitment to
            their students and shapes the trajectory of their lives and careers.</p>
